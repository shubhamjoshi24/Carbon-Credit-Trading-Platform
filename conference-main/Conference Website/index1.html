      <h2 class="conference-topic">1700s: ESG by Another Name</h2>
      <p>
        ESG considerations in investment and operations existed centuries before we called it ESG. The key drivers for ancient “exclusion list” or “code of conduct” prototypes were religion, moral norms, and cultural values. Some examples of value-based investment can be seen in the 1700s with the Quakers and Methodists in the United States and Europe who would exclude slave labor from their investment practices.

      <h2 class="conference-topic">1980s: The Rise of Social Responsibility Investment</h2>
      <p>
        As early as the 1960s, there was a growing movement for divestment from Apartheid South Africa before it came to the fore in the mid-1980s. Apartheid was an imposed system of rule based on racial segregation that lasted from 1948 to 30 June 1991 in South Africa. The divestment campaign and broader mounting political pressure from global players has been widely credited as one of the galvanizing forces leading to the end of Apartheid.

      <h2 class="conference-topic">1990s: Global Landmark Sustainability Legislation</h2>
      <p>
        The “Triple Bottom Line,” or the notion of People, Planet, Profit (PPP), was the first time businesses had to focus on two other P’s, beyond profits. The concept was the starting point of what later became ESG or SRI, growing in prominence following the ratification of legislation from the United Nations. In 1992, The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is established, signed by 154 states at Rio de Janeiro, coming into effect in March 1994. The overall goal of the UNFCCC is the “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic human-induced interference with the climate system.”
